//! The app's line to OMP (S9 U3, U4): one OMP process per workspace, started
//! the way the CLI starts it (`cedian_shell::launch`, the user's
//! `cedian.toml`, the spawn profile) on its own thread, so a dying OMP never
//! takes the IDE with it. Sessions live where OMP's CLI keeps them for the
//! project, so a session started in either opens in the other (ADR-0040
//! decision 5) and a restart's `open_session` adopts it; cedian's overlay
//! and audit log live in the workspace's state dir (ADR-0044).
//!
//! The link is cedian's gate for the app (§64): every tool execution and
//! every dialog outcome is a row in `audit.jsonl`. A person's answer is sent
//! and recorded in one step; a dialog still open when OMP dies, withdraws it
//! or is stopped is recorded as `abstain` (§63 lease, ADR-0013).
