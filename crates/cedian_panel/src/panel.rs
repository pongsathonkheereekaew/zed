//! The cedian dock panel (S9a T2/T4, S9 U3): one prompt box, the streamed OMP
//! reply rendered from the headless `cedian_agent::Thread`, and agent-edit
//! import.
//!
//! The panel starts OMP when it opens on a folder ([`crate::omp_link`]): its
//! own thread, the user's `cedian.toml`, the spawn profile. Events cross into
//! GPUI over a channel; edit-class tool events drive [`crate::import`]. When
//! OMP dies the panel says why and offers Restart; the IDE keeps running.
//!
//! OMP's dialogs (approvals, `confirm`, `input`, `editor`, `ask`) are answered
//! here (U4, §63): several can be open at once, keyed by request id. A turn
//! can be stopped, and images pasted into the composer go with the prompt.
//!
//! Every imported agent transaction feeds the task's [`TaskReview`] (U5,
//! §18, ADR-0006). A file OMP is about to write that is not open is opened
//! first, so its write is a reviewable transaction too. The Review Changes
//! view lists each file's hunks with Accept and Reject, Accept all, and
//! Revert turn.
